## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant strawberry red (#E53935) to evoke feelings of love, sweetness, and energy, and signal the core product. The design will skew feminine in styling, and this reflects that goal without resorting to cliches of 'girly' pink.
- Background color: Light pastel pink (#F8BBD0) to create a soft, inviting, and modern canvas, harmonious with the primary red.
- Accent color: Yellow-gold (#FFB300) as an attention-grabbing signal for key interactive elements.
- Body: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for clarity and approachability in recipe text and guides.
- Headers: 'Playfair' (serif) with its high-contrast letterforms will inject elegance and draw.
- Use sweet, elegant icons with heart and strawberry motifs throughout.
- Subtle animations on loading or when viewing video guides.
